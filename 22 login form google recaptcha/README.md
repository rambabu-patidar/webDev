# The Key Concept which I used are :

- [google reCAPTCHA v2](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/)
  - There are two method to implement this in our code:
    - Automatically rendering widge in our page (this one I used)
    - Explicit rendering widge (user can write code when it should appear)
  - fraud user can't able to submit the form anonymously
  - There is another version v3 available which is more good.
- [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions) (Regular Expression) in Javascript.
  - This helps us to compare and find patterns in javascript in strings.
- JavaScript Event Handler
  - submit Event
  - input Event
  - focus Event
  - blur Event
  - click Event
- [Adding and removing dynamic classes and attributes from HTML element](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-modify-attributes-classes-and-styles-in-the-dom)
- [FormData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) Interface
  - To get all the submitted data of our form in form of object.
- DOM methods

You can google each individual term on google and will find lot of resources about it.
Youtube it, google it, ask on twitter, ask on discord, but important is to learn no matter from where you learn.

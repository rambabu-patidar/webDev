    What is CSS?
    do your own.

    Remember that the minimum style in the HTML is applied to elements so that the user can 
    at least read the HTML Document. Otherwise the HTML document will be a whole text without 
    any Para and heading. See the MDN getting started CSS video availble.

    
    In which documents we can apply CSS?
    ans : HTML, MathML, XML, and many more.

    How to apply CSS?
    There are three way to put CSS in document
        1. External (Preferable)
        2. Internal (not Preferable)
        3. Inline (not preferable strictly)

    Which has more priority over another?
    The first two External and the Internal (via <style> element)
        both has same priority. The matter is that which one is kept first over other. As the documents get readed from above to down so the one who will appear last will be applied.
    
    The last one INLINE CSS has more precedence than both of the other method discussed and will be final if applied.

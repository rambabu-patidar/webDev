        <h1>vehicle counting application</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This is a sort of counter application that can be used in counting.</p>
        <p>As we were very curious in counting the number of vehicle that passed from road in front of our house.</p>
        <p>But many times we have to go inside our home as our mom call out for lunch etc.</p>
        <p>and we used to forgot the number of vehicle we counted previously to resume our counting.</p>
        <p>this application can help us in achieving that but one thing lack now is we can't go back in our childhood.</p>
        <p>still we can count if not doing anything. Right! so let's start the counting and save whenever you have been called by someone.</p>
        <p>i had done it enough and its your time. let's end my chit chat here.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h1>No. of vehicle</h1>
        <h2 id="count">0</h2>
     
       <button id="increment-btn" onclick="increase()" >Increase</button>
       <br>
        <button id="save-btn" onclick="save()">Save</button>
